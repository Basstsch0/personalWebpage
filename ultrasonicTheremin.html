<h1 id="ultrasound-based-theremin-with-raspberry-pi">Ultrasound-Based
Theremin with Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>In my high school project, I built an ultrasound-based Theremin using
a <strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong> and <strong>ultrasonic
sensors</strong>. The Theremin is an electronic musical instrument that
is typically played without physical contact, using the hands’ position
relative to antennas to control pitch and volume. My goal was to
recreate this functionality using ultrasonic sensors instead of the
traditional electromagnetic fields, while maintaining the unique, eerie
sound for which the Theremin is known.</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<h3 id="key-components">Key Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong>: The central processing unit
responsible for running the software that controls the sensors and
generates sound.</li>
<li><strong>Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)</strong>: These sensors were
used to detect hand position. One sensor measured the distance of the
hand to control the pitch, and the second sensor controlled the
volume.</li>
<li><strong>Pygame Library</strong>: This Python library was used for
audio playback. I mapped distances from the sensors to pre-recorded
piano notes, allowing the instrument to play sound based on hand
movement.</li>
<li><strong>Wooden Enclosure</strong>: A custom-built housing was made
to contain the electronics, with two drilled openings for the ultrasonic
sensors and space for the audio output.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="electronics-and-circuit-design">Electronics and Circuit
Design</h3>
<p>The circuit was relatively simple but required careful configuration
to ensure accurate distance measurement and sound generation. The
<strong>HC-SR04 sensors</strong> were both connected to the GPIO pins of
the Raspberry Pi in the following way:</p>
<img src="assets/mdData/plan.png" alt="Sensor connection" width="400"/>

<p>Each sensor had a specific role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensor 1</strong>: Controlled the pitch of the sound by
measuring the distance from the player’s hand. The distance was mapped
to specific musical notes. For example, moving the hand closer to the
sensor would produce a higher pitch, while moving it farther away would
lower the pitch.</li>
<li><strong>Sensor 2</strong>: Controlled the volume in a similar way,
adjusting the loudness of the sound based on hand distance. When the
hand was close, the volume was low, and as the hand moved away, the
volume increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sensors worked by emitting ultrasonic pulses and measuring the
time it took for the sound to bounce back after hitting the hand. This
allowed for precise distance measurement, which was then used to control
sound parameters.</p>
<h3 id="software-implementation">Software Implementation</h3>
<p>The project was programmed using <strong>Python</strong>. The
software was responsible for reading data from the ultrasonic sensors,
processing the measurements, and converting them into corresponding
sounds. I used the <strong>Pygame</strong> library to play pre-recorded
piano notes, mapping specific distances to individual notes. The program
also accounted for volume control, ensuring that the sound output
matched the distance detected by the second sensor.</p>
<h3 id="distance-testing-process">Distance Testing Process</h3>
<p>To ensure the accuracy of the sensors, I conducted multiple distance
tests. Using a simple setup, I marked specific distances from the
sensors and tested their ability to correctly measure hand positions.
The system was able to detect distances from <strong>5 cm to 30
cm</strong>, although accuracy dropped slightly at very close ranges.
These tests helped me refine the pitch and volume scaling, ensuring
smoother transitions between notes.</p>

<p>I also encountered challenges with sensor noise and occasional
inaccuracies, especially for distances under <strong>5 cm</strong>,
which required some tweaking of the code to ignore faulty readings. The
testing phase was crucial to fine-tuning the responsiveness of the
Theremin, as even small deviations could lead to incorrect note
generation.</p>
<h3 id="results-and-learnings">Results and Learnings</h3>
<p>While the final product successfully generated sound based on hand
movement, it didn’t perfectly emulate the mystical tones of a
traditional Theremin. Instead, it played discrete piano notes, which
gave it a more mechanical sound. However, the project was still a
success in demonstrating how ultrasonic sensors could be used to
replicate key aspects of the original instrument’s functionality.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaways from this project were learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensor integration</strong>: Using ultrasonic sensors for
distance measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Circuit design</strong>: Creating a simple but functional
electronic system.</li>
<li><strong>Python programming</strong>: Implementing sensor data
processing and audio playback.</li>
</ul>
